# Source files and prompts

This page maps the files involved in the extension's main flows and names where
each model prompt is defined. For the runtime sequence, see `architecture.md`.

## Find the implementation files

The frontend source is under `frontend/src`. The Python files under
`../scripts/ARGUS` are the source for the bundled ARGUS pipeline; `build.js`
copies them and the markdown prompts into the extension package.

| `artifact_retrieval.py`                   | Retrieves commit metadata, diffs, and related GitHub artifacts. It does not make an LLM call.                                |
| `rationale_sentence_identifier.py`        | Splits retrieved artifacts into sentences and asks the model to label rationale evidence.                                    |
| `rationale_generation.py`                 | Asks the model to synthesize the labeled evidence and code diff into GOAL, NEED, and ALTERNATIVES.                           |

| `sentence_splitter.py` and `csv_utils.py` | Shared sentence parsing and CSV read/write helpers.                                                                          |

## Find the prompts

Commit and selected-code analysis share the first three prompts. Selected-code
analysis adds a synthesis prompt. Each is assembled with run-specific input.

- **Connection check:** `cli_selftest.py` - `Reply with the single word OK.`
- **Evidence identification:** `prompts/evidence-identification.md`; built by
  `rationale_sentence_identifier.py`. Labels artifact sentences.
- **Per-commit rationale:** `prompts/commit-rationale.md`; built by
  `rationale_generation.py` with citation rules from `rationale_sources.py`.
  Summarizes diff and evidence.
- **Selected-code synthesis:** built by `selection_synthesis.py` with citation
  rules from `rationale_sources.py`. Combines commit summaries. Snapshot:
  `.prompt.txt` beside the synthesis output in VS Code global storage.

Prompt snapshots are created during a run, so they are not source files in the
repository. `rationale.runs` controls repeated evidence identification calls;
their labels are combined by majority vote.
